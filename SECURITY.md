## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Media Cut Pro seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Use the security label for non-critical issues
2. **Direct Contact**: For critical vulnerabilities, contact through GitHub
3. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY" in the issue title

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, code injection, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Within 48 hours**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- **Within 1 week**: We will provide a detailed response indicating next steps
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate the timing of the disclosure with you
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will publish a security advisory once the issue is resolved

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

1. **No Network Communication**: The application works completely offline
2. **Local File Processing**: All operations are performed locally
3. **No Data Collection**: No user data is collected or transmitted
4. **Sandboxed Execution**: FFmpeg processes run in controlled environment

### Dependencies

- **FFmpeg**: Included binaries are from official sources
- **Python Standard Library**: Uses only standard library modules
- **No Third-party Network Libraries**: No external network dependencies

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: Build process is documented and reproducible
- **Code Signing**: Executables should be code-signed (planned)
- **Integrity Checks**: Release packages include checksums

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage
1. **Download from Official Sources**: Only download from GitHub releases
2. **Verify Checksums**: Verify file integrity using provided checksums
3. **Run with Standard Privileges**: No administrator privileges required
4. **Scan Files**: Use antivirus software to scan downloaded files

### Input File Safety
1. **Trusted Sources**: Only process media files from trusted sources
2. **File Validation**: Be cautious with files from unknown sources
3. **Backup Important Data**: Always backup important files before processing

## Known Security Considerations

### FFmpeg Security
- FFmpeg is a powerful tool that processes binary media files
- Media files can potentially contain malicious data
- We use FFmpeg in stream copy mode to minimize processing risks

### File System Access
- The application requires read access to input files
- The application requires write access to output directories
- No access to sensitive system files or directories

### Memory Usage
- Large media files may consume significant memory
- Processing is designed to be memory-efficient
- No persistent storage of sensitive data

## Security Updates

### Update Policy
- Security updates will be released as soon as possible
- Critical security issues will receive emergency releases
- Users will be notified through GitHub releases and announcements

### Version Support
- We support the latest major version with security updates
- Previous versions may receive critical security fixes
- End-of-life versions will be clearly marked

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **GitHub Issues**: Use security label for non-critical issues
- **Direct Contact**: Contact through GitHub for critical issues
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
